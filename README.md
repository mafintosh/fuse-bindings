# fuse-bindings

Fully maintained fuse bindings for Node that aims to cover the entire FUSE api

```
npm install fuse-bindings
```

Compared to [fuse4js](https://github.com/bcle/fuse4js) these bindings cover almost the entire FUSE api (except for locking) and doesn't do
any buffer copys in read/write. It also supports unmount and mouting of multiple fuse drives.

## Requirements

You need to have FUSE installed (or Dokany on Windows)

* On Linux/Ubuntu `sudo apt-get install libfuse-dev`
* On OSX
  * if you use Brew, install [OSXFuse](http://osxfuse.github.com/) and `brew install pkg-config`
  * if you use MacPorts, `sudo port install osxfuse +devel`
* On Windows install [Dokany](https://github.com/dokan-dev/dokany)

### Windows
**WARNING**: Dokany is still not quite stable. It can cause BSODs. Be careful.

~~Using this on Windows is slightly more complicated. You need to install [Dokany](https://github.com/dokan-dev/dokany) (for `dokanfuse.lib`, `dokanctl.exe`, driver and service) **and** clone its repo (for the headers).~~

~~Once the Dokany repo is cloned, you also need to set environment variable `DOKAN_INSTALL_DIR` to the path to `DokenLibrary` of your Dokany installaton, and `DOKAN_FUSE_INCLUDE` to the path to `*dokany repo*\dokan_fuse\include`.~~

**EDIT**: Dokany now includes needed headers and sets proper environment variables when installing! Just install Dokany and this module should install and work just fine! (Drop an issue otherwise)

## Usage

Try creating an empty folder called `mnt` and run the below example

``` js
var fuse = require('fuse-bindings')

fuse.mount('./mnt', {
  readdir: function (path, cb) {
    console.log('readdir(%s)', path)
    if (path === '/') return cb(0, ['test'])
    cb(0)
  },
  getattr: function (path, cb) {
    console.log('getattr(%s)', path)
    if (path === '/') {
      cb(0, {
        mtime: new Date(),
        atime: new Date(),
        ctime: new Date(),
        size: 100,
        mode: 16877,
        uid: process.getuid(),
        gid: process.getgid()
      })
      return
    }

    if (path === '/test') {
      cb(0, {
        mtime: new Date(),
        atime: new Date(),
        ctime: new Date(),
        size: 12,
        mode: 33188,
        uid: process.getuid(),
        gid: process.getgid()
      })
      return
    }

    cb(fuse.ENOENT)
  },
  open: function (path, flags, cb) {
    console.log('open(%s, %d)', path, flags)
    cb(0, 42) // 42 is an fd
  },
  read: function (path, fd, buf, len, pos, cb) {
    console.log('read(%s, %d, %d, %d)', path, fd, len, pos)
    var str = 'hello world\n'.slice(pos)
    if (!str) return cb(0)
    buf.write(str)
    return cb(str.length)
  }
})

process.on('SIGINT', function () {
  fuse.unmount('./mnt', function () {
    process.exit()
  })
})
```

## API

#### `fuse.mount(mnt, ops, [cb])`

Mount a new filesystem on `mnt`.
Pass the FUSE operations you want to support as the `ops` argument.

#### `fuse.unmount(mnt, [cb])`

Unmount a filesystem

#### `fuse.context()`

Returns the current fuse context (pid, uid, gid).
Must be called inside a fuse callback.

## Mount options

#### `ops.options`

Set [mount options](http://blog.woralelandia.com/2012/07/16/fuse-mount-options/)

``` js
ops.options = ['direct_io'] // set the direct_io option
```

#### `ops.displayFolder`

Set to `true` to make OSX display a folder icon and the folder name as the mount point in finder

#### `ops.force`

Set to `true` to force mount the filesystem (will do an unmount first)

## FUSE operations

Most of the [FUSE api](http://fuse.sourceforge.net/doxygen/structfuse__operations.html) is supported. In general the callback for each op should be called with `cb(returnCode, [value])` where the return code is a number (`0` for OK and `< 0` for errors). See below for a list of POSIX error codes.

#### `ops.init(cb)`

Called on filesystem init.

#### `ops.access(path, mode, cb)`

Called before the filesystem accessed a file

#### `ops.statfs(path, cb)`

Called when the filesystem is being stat'ed. Accepts a fs stat object after the return code in the callback.

``` js
ops.statfs = function (path, cb) {
  cb(0, {
    bsize: 1000000,
    frsize: 1000000,
    blocks: 1000000,
    bfree: 1000000,
    bavail: 1000000,
    files: 1000000,
    ffree: 1000000,
    favail: 1000000,
    fsid: 1000000,
    flag: 1000000,
    namemax: 1000000
  })
}
```

#### `ops.getattr(path, cb)`

Called when a path is being stat'ed. Accepts a stat object (similar to the one returned in `fs.stat(path, cb)`) after the return code in the callback.

``` js
ops.getattr = function (path, cb) {
  cb(0, {
    mtime: new Date(),
    atime: new Date(),
    ctime: new Date(),
    size: 100,
    mode: 16877,
    uid: process.getuid(),
    gid: process.getgid()
  })
}
```

#### `ops.fgetattr(path, fd, cb)`

Same as above but is called when someone stats a file descriptor

#### `ops.flush(path, fd, cb)`

Called when a file descriptor is being flushed

#### `ops.fsync(path, fd, datasync, cb)`

Called when a file descriptor is being fsync'ed.

#### `ops.fsyncdir(path, fd, datasync, cb)`

Same as above but on a directory

#### `ops.readdir(path, cb)`

Called when a directory is being listed. Accepts an array of file/directory names after the return code in the callback

``` js
ops.readdir = function (path, cb) {
  cb(0, ['file-1.txt', 'dir'])
}
```

#### `ops.truncate(path, size, cb)`

Called when a path is being truncated to a specific size

#### `ops.ftruncate(path, fd, size, cb)`

Same as above but on a file descriptor

#### `ops.readlink(path, cb)`

Called when a symlink is being resolved. Accepts a pathname (that the link should resolve to) after the return code in the callback

``` js
ops.readlink = function (path, cb) {
  cb(null, 'file.txt') // make link point to file.txt
}
```

#### `ops.chown(path, uid, gid, cb)`

Called when ownership of a path is being changed

#### `ops.chmod(path, mode, cb)`

Called when the mode of a path is being changed

#### `ops.mknod(path, mode, dev, cb)`

Called when the a new device file is being made.

#### `ops.setxattr(path, name, buffer, length, offset, flags, cb)`

Called when extended attributes is being set (see the extended docs for your platform).
Currently you can read the attribute value being set in `buffer` at `offset`.

#### `ops.getxattr(path, name, buffer, length, offset, cb)`

Called when extended attributes is being read.
Currently you have to write the result to the provided `buffer` at `offset`.

#### `ops.open(path, flags, cb)`

Called when a path is being opened. `flags` in a number containing the permissions being requested. Accepts a file descriptor after the return code in the callback.

``` js
var toFlag = function(flags) {
  flags = flags & 3
  if (flags === 0) return 'r'
  if (flags === 1) return 'w'
  return 'r+'
}

ops.open = function (path, flags, cb) {
  var flag = toFlag(flags) // convert flags to a node style string
  ...
  cb(0, 42) // 42 is a file descriptor
}
```

#### `ops.opendir(path, flags, cb)`

Same as above but for directories

#### `ops.read(path, fd, buffer, length, position, cb)`

Called when contents of a file is being read. You should write the result of the read to the `buffer` and return the number of bytes written as the first argument in the callback.
If no bytes were written (read is complete) return 0 in the callback.

``` js
var data = new Buffer('hello world')

ops.read = function (path, fd, buffer, length, position, cb) {
  if (position >= data.length) return cb(0) // done
  var part = data.slice(position, position + length)
  part.copy(buffer) // write the result of the read to the result buffer
  cb(part.length) // return the number of bytes read
}
```

#### `ops.write(path, fd, buffer, length, position, cb)`

Called when a file is being written to. You can get the data being written in `buffer` and you should return the number of bytes written in the callback as the first argument.

``` js
ops.write = function (path, fd, buffer, length, position, cb) {
  console.log('writing', buffer.slice(0, length))
  cb(length) // we handled all the data
}
```

#### `ops.release(path, fd, cb)`

Called when a file descriptor is being released. Happens when a read/write is done etc.

#### `ops.releasedir(path, fd, cb)`

Same as above but for directories

#### `ops.create(path, mode, cb)`

Called when a new file is being opened.

#### `ops.utimens(path, atime, mtime, cb)`

Called when the atime/mtime of a file is being changed.

#### `ops.unlink(path, cb)`

Called when a file is being unlinked.

#### `ops.rename(src, dest, cb)`

Called when a file is being renamed.

#### `ops.link(src, dest, cb)`

Called when a new link is created.

#### `ops.symlink(src, dest, cb)`

Called when a new symlink is created

#### `ops.mkdir(path, mode, cb)`

Called when a new directory is being created

#### `ops.rmdir(path, cb)`

Called when a directory is being removed

#### `ops.destroy(cb)`

Both `read` and `write` passes the underlying fuse buffer without copying them to be as fast as possible.
